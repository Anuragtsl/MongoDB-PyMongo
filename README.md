# MongoDB-PyMongo

MongoDB is a document based database with a dynamic data schema. The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) that it supports is a natural fit for working with objects in modern programming languages like JavaScript, Python and others. This provides an alternative to more traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) such as SQL. MongoDB is an example of a NoSQL databases. These databases often use collections of documents instead of the tables used in RDBMS. These databases support dynamic database schemas making them responsive to changes in the structure of data.

Pymongo is a Python driver for MongoDB allowing you to interact with Mongo databases using Python.

# Conclusion

In summary, MongoDB is a powerful and scalable database that is very useful when the data schema is prone to frequent change. This lends itself to integration with modern software systems easily and can also be used as part of a data analysis pipeline when analysing data in JSON format, such as some mobile app data or Twitter data. MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases and an awareness of what it is and how it works is a must for software engineers and data scientists.
